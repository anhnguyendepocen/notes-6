## Some long data that should be wide

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d <- tribble(
  ~obs, ~time, ~y,
  1, "pre", 19,
  2, "post", 18,
  3, "pre", 17,
  4, "post", 16,
  5, "pre", 15,
  6, "post", 14
)
d
```

- Six observations of variable `y`, but three measured before some treatment and three measured after. 
- Really matched pairs, so want column of `y`-values for `pre` and for `post`.
- `pivot_wider`.

## What happens here?

```{r}
d %>% pivot_wider(names_from = time, values_from = y)
```

- Should be *three* `pre` values and *three* `post`. 
- Why did this happen?
- `pivot_wider` needs to know which *row* to put each observation in.
- Uses combo of columns *not* named in `pivot_wider`, here `obs` (only).

## The problem

```{r}
d %>% pivot_wider(names_from = time, values_from = y)
```

- There are 6 different `obs` values, so 6 different rows.
- No data for `obs` 2 and `pre`, so that cell missing (`NA`).
- Not enough data (6 obs) to fill 12 ($= 2 \times 6$) cells.
- `obs` needs to say which subject provided which *2* observations.

## Fixing it up

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d2 <- tribble(
  ~subject, ~time, ~y,
  1, "pre", 19,
  1, "post", 18,
  2, "pre", 17,
  2, "post", 16,
  3, "pre", 15,
  3, "post", 14
)
d2
```

- column `subject` shows which subject provided each `pre` and `post`. 
- when we do `pivot_wider`, now only *3* rows, one per subject.

## Coming out right

```{r}
d2 %>% pivot_wider(names_from = time, values_from = y)
```

- row each observation goes to determined by other column `subject`, and now a `pre` and `post` for each `subject`.
- right layout for matched pairs $t$ or to make differences for sign test or normal quantile plot.
- "spaghetti plot" needs data longer, as `d2`.

## Spaghetti plot

```{r}
d2 %>% mutate(time = fct_inorder(time)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = y, group = subject)) +
    geom_point() + geom_line() -> g
```


```{r}
```

## The spaghetti plot

```{r}
g
```

- each subject's `y` decreases over time, with subject 1 highest overall.

## Another example

- Two independent samples this time

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d3 <- tribble(
  ~group, ~y,
  "control", 8,
  "control", 11,
  "control", 13,
  "control", 14,
  "treatment", 12,
  "treatment", 15,
  "treatment", 16,
  "treatment", 17,
)
d3
```
- These should be arranged like this
- but what if we make them wider?

## wider

```{r}
d3 %>% pivot_wider(names_from = group, values_from = y)
```

- row determined by what not used for `pivot_wider`: nothing!
- everything smooshed into *one* row!
- this time, too *much* data for the layout.
- Four data values squeezed into each of the two cells: "list-columns".

## Get the data out

- To expand list-columns out into the data values they contain, can use `unnest`:

```{r}
d3 %>% pivot_wider(names_from = group, values_from = y) %>% 
  unnest(c(control, treatment))
```
- in this case, wrong layout, because data values not paired.

## A proper use of list-columns

```{r}
d3 %>% nest_by(group) %>% 
  summarize(n = nrow(data), 
            mean_y = mean(data$y), 
            sd_y = sd(data$y))
```

- another way to do `group_by` and `summarize` to find stats by group.
- run this one piece at a time to see what it does.
